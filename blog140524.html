                            <span>14 May 2024/Portfolio Website</span>
                            <p>When I decided to create a portfolio website, I sought the most economical way to build and launch it. I experimented with various website builder platforms and even attempted to create the website using Python, but I never got around to hosting it. After thorough research, I realized that creating my own website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript would be the best approach.</p>
                            <p>Having some familiarity with HTML from my college days, I felt confident in my ability to build a website from scratch. As a computer science graduate, leveraging these foundational skills seemed like the logical choice. Plus, I discovered that the time and effort required to build a website using a website builder were comparable, and I would have much more control over the design and functionality by building it myself.</p>
                            <p>I decided to document my journey and share it as a guide for others who may have limited technical knowledge or a tight budget but still want to create a professional-looking website. By utilizing basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I was able to achieve my goal without breaking the bank or relying on third-party platforms.</p>
                            <p>In my upcoming post, I'll outline the steps I took, the resources I used, and the challenges I encountered along the way. Stay tuned for tips and insights on how to build your own website with minimal knowledge and cost.</p>

                                <div class="blog-titlesub">Significance of Website </div>
                                <p>A Portfolio website can significantly propel your career in several ways:</p>
                                <p><strong>Professional  Presence:</strong> Having your own website gives you a professional online presence that showcases your skills, experience, and achievements. It serves as a centralized hub where potential employers, clients, or collaborators can learn more about you.</p>
                                <p><strong>Personal Branding</strong>Your website allows you to establish and strengthen your personal brand. You can tailor the design, content, and tone to reflect your unique identity, values, and expertise. Consistent branding across your website and other online platforms helps you stand out in a competitive market.</p>
                                <p><strong>Portfolio Showcase:</strong>For creative professionals, entrepreneurs, or freelancers, a portfolio website is essential for showcasing your work. You can display your projects, case studies, or past successes in a visually appealing and organized manner, demonstrating your skills and capabilities to prospective clients or employers.</p>
                                <p><strong>Content Sharing:</strong>Through a blog or articles section on your website, you can share your insights, expertise, and industry knowledge with a wider audience. Regularly publishing valuable content not only establishes you as a thought leader in your field but also helps you connect with like-minded individuals and attract opportunities for collaboration or networking.</p>
                                <p><strong>Networking and Outreach: </strong>Your website serves as a powerful networking tool, allowing you to reach out to potential clients, employers, collaborators, or mentors. You can include contact information, social media links, or inquiry forms to facilitate communication and engagement with visitors.</p>
                                <p><strong>Career Development:</strong>A website can support your ongoing career development efforts by documenting your professional journey, accomplishments, and skills development. You can use it to track your progress, set goals, and showcase your continuous growth and learning to prospective employers or clients.</p>
                                <p><strong>Global Reach: </strong>Unlike traditional methods of networking or job searching, a website has the potential to reach a global audience 24/7. Whether you're targeting local opportunities or seeking international clients or collaborators, your website provides a platform for expanding your reach and visibility beyond geographical boundaries.</p>
                                <p>In summary, a dedicated website can serve as a powerful asset in advancing your career by enhancing your professional image, showcasing your work, facilitating networking and outreach, and supporting your ongoing career development efforts. It's an investment in your personal brand and future success.</p>

                                    <div class="blog-titlesub">Building and Launching Your Own Website</div>
                                    <p>Building a website is a rewarding process that starts with setting up a development environment. Begin by installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a popular code editor. Next, explore website templates available on platforms like templated.co for inspiration. Once you've chosen a template, customize it with your content</p>
                                    <p>To enhance your understanding of HTML and CSS, consider watching tutorials on platforms like freeCodeCamp.org. These resources offer comprehensive guidance on website development fundamentals.</p>
                                    <p>After completing your website, it's time to secure a domain name. Porkbun.com and Cloudflare.com are reputable domain providers offering affordable options, typically under $11 annually. Once you've registered your domain, you can host your site on GitHub for free. GitHub also provides a straightforward process for setting up a custom domain.</p>
                                    <p>This setup offers flexibility, allowing you to switch hosting providers if needed. Whether you're just starting or looking to expand your online presence, this approach provides a solid foundation for building and launching your website.</p>
